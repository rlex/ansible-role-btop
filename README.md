### Description

Extremely sophisticated and advanced role that downloads and installs [btop](https://github.com/aristocratos/btop).  
Literally 30 lines of "code". Tests for that are much bigger.

### Variables

The only variable in this role is btop_version, which you can use to set version from [btop releases](https://github.com/aristocratos/btop/releases)

### Why

I happen to have some old systems where btop isn't packaged, and i'm too lazy to write packaging scripts for it.
